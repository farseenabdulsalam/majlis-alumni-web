    <p>Every monsoon, along with its soft smell of soil brings with it a bag of
    zestful memories. Memories of good old days. The sound of Shubhayatra,
    Swaraj Mazda and Touristor.. from where we began our journey to the
    wonderland.. to Majlis.</p>
    <p> In the Junes, we watched our little brothers
    entering into this new world, terrified, which always took us back to the
    flashbacks of our own royal entrance üòâ  .. Then we made new friends, some
    of whom where destined to be with us, in laughs and tears, for the rest of
    our life.</p>
    <p>Then comes August, with the glorious independence day
    celebrations. Those who came by line buses where the first to lead the
    class decoration competition. The school van kids had even more fun. Each
    one of them, with unprecedented unity strived hard for their team for the
    *unofficial* inter-van decorarion competition.  </p>
    <p>After three months of academic chaos, winter brings us the most awaited
    event of the year. Thats it, the sports meet!. Boys and girls of all ages 
    have been waiting with unbelievable enthusiasm for this one day. We ran, we
    sprint, we jumped.. And of course the show of the day, extremely risky
    yet the most enjoyed blindfolded pot breaking. Oh, how many time had we ran
    to grab the sweets those fell out of the pot. Only to be chased back out of
    the boundary by our teachers by the way.
    </p>
    <p>Unforgettable forever are those moments, the performance.. 
    
    <p>The glorious meet of talent and enthusiasm dives into the horizon of
    memories with the holy war of tug. For a long time, our one and only Nishad
    was the most wanted and most bargained player for the item. After the
    glorious fight and the declaration of winner ends an ever memorable chapter
    in our life. With the legends of sports  sharing the cup of victory,
    curtain falls only to rise in another fine morning to rewrite history
    una vez m√°.</p>

    <h2>The Alumni Association</h2>
    <p>It's been a long cherished dream of our most prestigious fellow
    Majlisians to organize a platform to keep us connected to Majlis and other
    Majlisians, to give something abck to the institution which gave us
    everything.</p>
    <p>There's been immense effort from beloved Nikhil Kurian, Akhil Kurian and
    Basith from the days they were still there in Majlis. Unfortunately,
    despite years of efforts, we still don't have an association. We attempted
    to organize a meet up a few years ago. But it was not up to our
    expectations due to lack of participation. This year we are planning it to
    make it as vivid as possible by including as much of you as possible. </p>
    <p>We have been conducting discussions after discussions to come up with a
    date agreeable for <em>most of us</em>. Thanks to beloved Dr. Haseeb,
    Shareef, Akhil and Nikhil for their sincere guidance and suggestions. I
    would also like to thank the strong support from Sahal, Ramsheer and
    Basith. Huge thanks goes to Thufail, Shamil and Sithara, who had put great
    efforts to reach their fellow majlisians to spread the news and get
    suggestions.</p>
