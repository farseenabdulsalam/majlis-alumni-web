    <p>Every monsoon, along with its soft smell of soil brings with it a bag of
    zestful memories. Memories of good old days. The sound of Shubhayatra,
    Swaraj Mazda and Tourister.. from where we began our journey to the
    wonderland.. to Majlis.</p>
    <p> In the Junes, we watched our little brothers
    entering into this new world, terrified, which always took us back to the
    flashbacks of our own royal entrance ðŸ˜‰  .. Then we made new friends, some
    of whom where destined to be with us, in laughs and tears, for the rest of
    our life.</p>
    <p>Then comes August, with the glorious independence day
    celebrations. Those who came by line buses where the first to lead the
    class decoration competition. The school van kids had even more fun. Each
    one of them, with unprecedented unity strived hard for their team for the
    *unofficial* inter-van decorarion competition.  </p>

    <h2>The Alumni Association</h2>
    <p>It's been a long cherished dream of our most prestigious fellow
    Majlisians to organize a platform to keep us connected to Majlis and other
    Majlisians, to give something abck to the institution which gave us
    everything.</p>
    <p>There's been immense effort from beloved Nikhil Kurian, Akhil Kurian and
    Basith from the days they were still there in Majlis. Unfortunately,
    despite years of efforts, we still don't have an association. We attempted
    to organize a meet up a few years ago. But it was not up to our
    expectations due to lack of participation. This year we are planning it to
    make it as vivid as possible by including as much of you as possible. </p>
